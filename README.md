# Escape-the-underground-cell
A simple text-based adventure game I wrote in Python when I was 15

## Getting started
You can play this game for free on [Replit.com](https://replit.com/@ninjasmosa/Escape-the-underground-cell?v=1). Alternatively you can download the .py file by clicking into the releases section. You can then run it in your own Python IDE and modify the code as you wish.


Preferably I would like you to credit me if you decide to release a fork of this game with your modifications, but this is licensed under MIT so I'm not sure if that's a requirement.
